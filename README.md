# Arras.io World Records Archive Scripts
A script that automates the process of approving a World Record/Highest Arras Scores submission down to simply typing 1 letter (currently 'k'). Also included is an updated version of a previous script that calculates useful statistics about the Players and Tanks on the WRA spreadsheet.

This essentially makes the process of approving world records for Arras comparable to the speed and methods used by the Diep World Records Archive, who also merely have to make a small action to indicate record approval (for them, its clicking a button), and then watch as their website's backend code takes care of putting the record submission where it needs to go.
